## 1. The Problem: "Digital Loneliness & Creator Block"
- **Disconnection:** Existing social platforms prioritize viral fame over niche community bonding.
- **The Content Gap:** Users want to contribute but don't know *what* to post (Creator's Block).
- **Algorithmic Fatigue:** Feeds are cluttered with irrelevant content, losing the "community" feel.

## 2. The Solution: CRIDGE
Cridge is an AI-native social ecosystem where communities (Guilds) thrive through AI-assisted creativity.
- **AI as a Catalyst:** Not just a filter, but a brainstorming partner.
- **Short-Form Focus:** Immersive, vertical "Sparks" that capture raw community energy.
- **Vibe-Centric:** Communities are organized into "Guilds" with distinct aesthetic identities.

## 3. Key Product Features
- **Daily Sparks (AI-Generated):** Personalized content prompts generated by Gemini based on user skills and interests.
- **"Add Sauce" (AI Refinement):** Transform boring updates into high-energy, community-ready captions with one tap.

- **The Spark Feed:** A high-fidelity, TikTok-style vertical feed for rapid content consumption.

## 4. The Secret Sauce: Gemini 3 Flash
